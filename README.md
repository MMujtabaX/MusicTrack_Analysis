üìÅ Project Description
The Tracks project reads a local .xml file (typically an exported iTunes music library) and:

Parses the XML structure

Extracts music metadata (such as Track Name, Artist, Album, Play Count, Rating, etc.)

Stores the data in an SQLite database using a normalized schema

This project reinforces key concepts:

Using ElementTree for XML parsing

Writing normalized relational data to SQLite

Joining and querying across multiple tables
